# this course
I decided to take the Introduction to DevOps for several reasons. First, I had heard about DevOps from colleagues, so the topic was a bit unknown to me. I never found a course that interested me or was the right time, right place until now when I got a recommendation from my study advisor at Metropolia.

At work, we use Agile and Azure DevOps, so to become a Product Owner I thought the course would give me a good introduction to what is DevOps. For example, I had no idea DevOps was a way of thinking and doing things to improve the deliverability and quality of software. I thought, probably like a few other people, that it was a set of tools. I also thought I would have to read and watch a lot of content and peer review other peopleâ€™s work.

I was looking for something simple, so the course description, material and learning outcomes checked those boxes. I did expect there to be some technical issues since I sometimes struggle with having the right computer and OS to complete assignments.

I am open to trying new learning sites, so I decided to give FiTech a chance. While looking through the course list I noticed I did have not a lot of time to enroll in this course and the course was starting soon, so that was a reason for taking the course. It just so happened that it fit in nicely with my work and study schedules since I have not been able to attend a face-to-face course at Metropolia for over two years.
