# About
Hello, my is William. I live in Helsinki and work in Espoo. Currently, I am a Product Owner at Visual Components, a 3D software company for simulating manufacturing, robotics and other areas of industry. In my free time, I study IT via an evening studies program at Metropolia, spend time with my family, and make online tutorials.

My interests in IT and computer science are mostly related to work. Before my son was born, I decided to get an engineering degree, which would help advance my career and skill sets. I gravitated toward networking, but I donâ€™t get to do any of that at work. Nowadays, I work on product management side of software engineering, and learning DevOps has definitely helped me become a better Product Owner.
